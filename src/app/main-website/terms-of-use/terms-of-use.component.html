 <ol>
 <li><strong>Online privacy policy for children</strong></li>
 </ol>
 <p>This Children’s Online Privacy Policy explains our information collection, disclosure, and parental consent practices with respect to information provided by children under the age of 18 (“child” or “children”). This policy is in accordance with the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and the The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO Act) in India.</p>
 <p>Nidara Child Development and Educational Services offers to its users a range applications primarily targeted at children and their families. Our site and applications offer a variety of activities, including activities that may collect information from children. Below we summarize potential instances of collection and outline how and when we will provide parental notice and/or seek parental consent. In any instance that we collect personal information from a child, we will retain that information only so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the activity request or allow the child to continue to participate in the activity, and ensure the security of our users and our services, or as required by law. In the event we discover we have collected information from a child in a manner inconsistent with this policy or prevailing laws, we will either delete the information or immediately seek the parent’s consent for that collection.</p>
 <p><strong>Registration</strong></p>
 <p>Children are registered with our sites and applications, either at the request of participating schools or on application by parents, to view content, online lessons, answer online questions and carry out tasks and exercises, play games, participate in online activities and contests, and engage in special features, among other things. During the registration process, we may obtain certain information about the child for notification and security purposes, including a parent or guardian’s email address, the child’s first name and gender, the child’s member or account username, and password. In order to provide more accurate information on child development milestones and parameters like nutrition, height and weight, we may use your child’s grade level as given by you. We seek your prior consent before in order to provide more accurate activities.</p>
 <p>Where the registration is at the request of participating schools, we will obtain consents from teachers and school administrators to act in the stead of parents to provide consent for the collection of personal information from children. In such cases, schools should always notify parents about these activities. If the registration is at the request of parents, we take the consent of parents.</p>
 <p>We strongly advise children and their parents never to provide any personal information in their usernames. Please note that children can choose whether to share their information with us, but certain features cannot function without it. As a result, children may not be able to access certain features if required information has not been provided. We will not require a child to provide more information than is reasonably necessary in order to participate in an online activity.</p>
 <p>If a child is under 18 years of age, we require parent or guardian email address for allowing the child to access our site.&nbsp; A child is not allowed to access our site on their own.&nbsp; All information and access given by the child is the responsibility of the parent only. We will not use parent emails provided for parental consent purposes to market to the parent, unless the parent has expressly opted in to email marketing or has separately participated in an activity that allows for such email contact.</p>
 <p><strong>Content Generated by a Child</strong></p>
 <p>Certain activities on our sites and applications allow children to create or manipulate content and save it on our sites. Some of these activities do not require children to provide any personal information and therefore may not result in notice to the parent or require parental consent.</p>
 <p>If an activity potentially allows a child to insert personal information in their created content, we will either pre-screen the submission to delete any personal information, or we will seek verifiable parental consent by email for the collection. Examples of created content that may include personal information are stories or other open-text fields, and drawings that allow text or free-hand entry of information. If, in addition to collecting content that includes personal information, we also plan to post the content publicly or share it with a third party for the third party’s own use, by accepting our terms of use, you agree to having it shared with third parties.</p>
 <p><strong>Verifiable Parental Consent:</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Email Consent.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>In the event we intend collecting personal information from a child, we will first seek a parent or guardian’s consent by email and in the case of registration by participating schools, participating doctors and hospitals, consent of such schools/ hospitals/ doctors, explaining what information we are collecting, how we plan to use it, how the parent/guardian/school/ doctor/ hospital can provide consent, and how the parent can revoke consent. If we do not receive the consent within a reasonable time, we will delete such information and any other information collected from the child in connection with that activity.</p>
 <p><strong>High-Level Consent.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>If we collect personal information from a child that is likely to be posted publicly, we will seek written consent from parents/guardians/school.</p>
 <p><strong>Chat</strong></p>
 <p>Certain games and activities that are directed to children allow users to communicate directly with other users by means of a chat system. In most cases, these chat systems employ filters that are intended to prevent the communication of both personal information and age-inappropriate words and phrases. In addition to filters, we may employ live moderation and/or encourage other users to flag inappropriate communications. We strongly encourage children who use these interactive features on our sites and applications never to provide personal information about themselves or any third party, and certainly never to attempt to circumvent our filters or moderation. We also recommend that parents/guardians/schools to carefully supervise their children when the children participate in online activities.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Email Contact with a Child</strong></p>
 <p>We will not email the child directly for any information.&nbsp; If we need information about the child for any reason, we will contact the parent only.&nbsp; It is the parent’s sole responsibility to communicate with us and share information with us.&nbsp; We do not hold any responsibility on this part.</p>
 <p><strong>Push Notifications</strong></p>
 <p>Push notifications are notifications on mobile and other devices that are typically associated with downloaded applications, and which can communicate to the device holder even when the application is not in use. We will require a child to provide a parent/guardian email address before the child can receive push notifications from our child-directed applications that collect a device identifier. We will then provide the parent/guardian with notice of our contact with the child and will provide the parent the opportunity to prevent further notifications. Finally, we will not associate the device identifier with other personal information without contacting the parent to get consent.</p>
 <p><strong>Persistent Identifiers</strong></p>
 <p>When children interact with us, certain information may automatically be collected, both to make our sites and applications more interesting and useful to children and for various purposes related to our business. Examples include the type of computer operating system, the child’s IP address or mobile device identifier, the web browser, the frequency with which the child visits various parts of our sites or applications, and information regarding the online or mobile service provider. This information is collected using technologies such as cookies, flash cookies, web beacons, and other unique identifiers. This information may be collected by us or by a third party. This data is principally used for internal purposes only, in order to:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>provide children with access to features and activities on our sites and applications</li>
 <li>customize content and improve our sites and applications</li>
 <li>conduct research and analysis to address the performance of our sites and applications</li>
 <li>generate anonymous reporting for use by us</li>
 </ul>
 <p>In the event we collect (or allow others to collect) such information from children on our sites and applications for other purposes, we will notify parents/guardians/ schools and obtain consent prior to such collection.</p>
 <p>In addition to those rare instances where a child’s personal information is posted publicly (after receiving parental/guardian/school consent), we also may share or disclose personal information collected from children in a limited number of instances, including the following:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>To our service providers if necessary for them to perform a business, professional, or technology support function for us.</li>
 <li>If required by law, in response to a court order or a subpoena.</li>
 <li>In response to a law enforcement or public agency’s (including schools or children services) request;</li>
 <li>If we believe disclosure may prevent the instigation of a crime, facilitate an investigation related to public safety or protect the safety of a child using our sites or applications;</li>
 <li>To protect the security or integrity of our sites, applications, and other technology, as well as the technology of our service providers; or</li>
 <li>enable us to take precautions against liability.</li>
